SECURITY
    Some information of non-currently logged-in accounts can be modified by directly entering a specific URL with
    other user's id. This is because the Django built-in UpdateView class ask to use url to pass primary key value.
    
    Those view functions I defined do not have this problem because I wrap all value into POST form. But they still
    can be intentionally modified by the browser's inspect tool.
